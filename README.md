- Hi, I’m @Klwd(ie)  ૮₍ ´ ꒳ `₎ა
- I’m interested in Cybersecurity and Development.
- I’m currently working on Penetration Testing and Full Stack Development. I am gearing up to do the OSCP and working to make [my personal website](https://klwdie.github.io/Raphaels_Webpage/index.html) a reality!

  (I have minor Python projects I've worked on and made like a calculator but it is a bit embarrassing to put here.)  ૮₍´｡ᵔ ꈊ ᵔ｡`₎ა
- You can always reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klwd/).
- Fun fact: I love Pompompurin.
